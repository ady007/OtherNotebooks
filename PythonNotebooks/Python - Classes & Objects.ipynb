Integers represent whole numbers in the range of –2147483648 to 2147483647 (the range may be larger on some machines). Long integers represent whole numbers of unlimited range (limited only by available memory).Although there are two integer types, Python tries to make the distinction seamless (in fact, in Python 3, the two types have been unified into a single integer type).Thus, although you will sometimes see ref- erences to long integers in existing Python code, this is mostly an implementation detail that can be ignored—just use the integer type for all integer operations.The one excep- tion is in code that performs explicit type checking for integer values. In Python 2, the expression isinstance(x, int) will return False if x is an integer that has been promoted to a long.\n",

    "When Python is looking up an instance variable, if it can’t find an instance variable of that name, it will then try to find and return the value in a class variable of the same name. Only if it can’t find an appropriate class variable will it signal an error. This does make it efficient to implement default values for instance variables; just create a class variable with the same name and appropriate default value, and avoid the time and memory overhead of initializing that instance variable every time a class instance is created. But this also makes it easy to inadvertently refer to an instance variable rather than a class variable, without signaling an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as in Java, you can invoke **static methods** even though no instance of that class has been created, although you can call them using a class instance. To create a static method, use the @staticmethod decorator,\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class methods** are similar to static methods in that they can be invoked before an object of the class has been instantiated or by using an instance of the class. But class methods are implicitly passed the class they belong to as their first parameter, so you can code them more simply,"

    "The repr function always returns what might be loosely called the formal string representation of a Python object. More specifically, repr returns a string representation of a Python object from which the original object can be rebuilt. For large, complex objects, this may not be the sort of thing you wish to see in debugging output or status reports. Python also provides the built-in str function. In contrast to repr, str is intended to produce printable string representations, and it can be applied to any Python object. str returns what might be called the informal string representation of the object. A string returned by str need not define an object fully and is intended to be read by humans, not by Python code. You won’t notice any difference between repr and str when you first start using them, because until you begin using the object-oriented features of Python, there is no difference. str applied to any built-in Python object always calls repr to calculate its result. It’s only when you start defining your own classes that the difference between str and repr becomes important."
