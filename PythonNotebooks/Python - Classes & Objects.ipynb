    "A class in Python is effectively a data type. All the data types built into Python are classes, and Python gives you powerful tools to manipulate every aspect of a class’s behavior.\n",

    "A **class variable** is a variable associated with a class, not an instance of a class, and is accessed by all instances of the class, in order to keep track of some class-level information, such as how many instances of the class have been created at any point in time. Python provides class variables, although using them requires slightly more effort than in most other languages. Also, you need to watch out for an interaction between class and instance variables. They can be invoked by classname.classvariable\n",
    "\n",
    "When Python is looking up an instance variable, if it can’t find an instance variable of that name, it will then try to find and return the value in a class variable of the same name. Only if it can’t find an appropriate class variable will it signal an error. This does make it efficient to implement default values for instance variables; just create a class variable with the same name and appropriate default value, and avoid the time and memory overhead of initializing that instance variable every time a class instance is created. But this also makes it easy to inadvertently refer to an instance variable rather than a class variable, without signaling an error.\n",

More specifically, repr returns a string representation of a Python object from which the original object can be rebuilt. For large, complex objects, this may not be the sort of thing you wish to see in debugging output or status reports. Python also provides the built-in str function. In contrast to repr, str is intended to produce printable string representations, and it can be applied to any Python object. str returns what might be called the informal string representation of the object. A string returned by str need not define an object fully and is intended to be read by humans, not by Python code. You won’t notice any difference between repr and str when you first start using them, because until you begin using the object-oriented features of Python, there is no difference. str applied to any built-in Python object always calls repr to calculate its result. It’s only when you start defining your own classes that the difference between str and repr becomes important."
