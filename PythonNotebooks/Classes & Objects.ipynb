Python provides class variables, although using them requires slightly more effort than in most other languages. Also, you need to watch out for an interaction between class and instance variables. They can be invoked by classname.classvariable\n",

Only if it can’t find an appropriate class variable will it signal an error. This does make it efficient to implement default values for instance variables; just create a class variable with the same name and appropriate default value, and avoid the time and memory overhead of initializing that instance variable every time a class instance is created. But this also makes it easy to inadvertently refer to an instance variable rather than a class variable, without signaling an error.\n",

    "It’s important to note that a class statement by itself doesn’t create any instances of the class (for example, no accounts are actually created in the preceding example). Rather, a class merely sets up the attributes that will be common to all the instances that will be created later. In this sense, you might think of it as a blueprint. The functions defined inside a class are known as instance methods. An instance method is a function that operates on an instance of the class, which is passed as the first argument. By convention, this argument is called self, although any legal identifier name can be used. In the preceding example, deposit(), withdraw(), and inquiry() are examples of instance methods. Class variables such as num_accounts are values that are shared among all instances of a class (that is, they’re not individually assigned to each instance). In this case, it’s a variable that’s keeping track of how many Account instances are in existence."

The explicit use of self is required because Python does not provide a means to explicitly declare variables (that is, a declaration such as int x or float y in C). Without this, there is no way to know whether an assignment to a variable in a method is supposed to be a local variable or if it’s supposed to be saved as an instance attribute. The explicit use of self fixes this—all values stored on self are part of the instance and all other assignments are just local variables.\n",

    "Inheritance is a mechanism for creating a new class that specializes or modifies the behavior of an existing class.The original class is called a base class or a superclass.The new class is called a derived class or a subclass.When a class is created via inheritance, it “inherits” the attributes defined by its base classes. However, a derived class may redefine any of these attributes and add new attributes of its own. Inheritance is specified with a comma-separated list of base-class names in the class statement. If there is no logical base class, a class inherits from object, as has been shown in prior examples. object is a class which is the root of all Python objects and which provides the default implementation of some common methods such as __str__(), which creates a string for use in printing.Inheritance is often used to redefine the behavior of existing methods.As an example, here’s a specialized version of Account that redefines the inquiry() method to periodically overstate the current balance with the hope that someone not paying close attention will overdraw his account and incur a big penalty when making a payment on their subprime mortgage:"
