    "A for loop in Python is different from for loops in some other languages. The traditional pattern is to increment and test a variable on each iteration, which is what C for loops usually do. In Python, a for loop iterates over the values returned by any **iterable object—that is, any object that can yield a sequence of values**. For example, a for loop can iterate over every element in a list, a tuple, or a string. But an iterable object can also be a special function called range or a special type of function called **a generator**. This can be quite powerful. The general form is  \n",

    "Given a number n, range(n) returns a sequence 0, 1, 2, …, n–2, n–1. So, passing it the length of a list (found using len) produces a sequence of the indices for that list’s elements. The range function doesn’t build a Python list of integers—it just appears to. Instead, it creates a range object that produces integers on demand. This is useful when you’re using explicit loops to iterate over really large lists. Instead of building a list with 10 million elements in it, for example, which would take up quite a bit of memory, you can use range(10000000), which takes up only a small amount of memory and generates a sequence of integers from 0 up to 10000000 as needed by the for loop.  \n",

If you use range with two numeric arguments, the first argument is the starting number for the resulting sequence and the second number is the number the resulting sequence goes up to (but doesn’t include)."
