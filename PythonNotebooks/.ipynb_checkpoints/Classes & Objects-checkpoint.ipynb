    "The repr function always returns what might be loosely called the formal string representation of a Python object. More specifically, repr returns a string representation of a Python object from which the original object can be rebuilt. For large, complex objects, this may not be the sort of thing you wish to see in debugging output or status reports. Python also provides the built-in str function. In contrast to repr, str is intended to produce printable string representations, and it can be applied to any Python object. str returns what might be called the informal string representation of the object. A string returned by str need not define an object fully and is intended to be read by humans, not by Python code. You won’t notice any difference between repr and str when you first start using them, because until you begin using the object-oriented features of Python, there is no difference. str applied to any built-in Python object always calls repr to calculate its result. It’s only when you start defining your own classes that the difference between str and repr becomes important."
